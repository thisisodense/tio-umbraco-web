    <p>
        This website is out of sync with the <em>{{environment.destination}}</em> website you are trying to transfer to.

        That means that important components have been updated here or on the <em>{{environment.destination}}</em> website, but the changes have not been synced between the 2 websites.
    </p>

    <p>
        To solve this problem, open your git console, and ensure that all changes have been pulled from <em>{{environment.destination}}</em> and that all your local changes have been committed and pushed.
    </p>

    <p>Git commands:</p>
    <pre>
    /> git pull
    /> git add .
    /> git commit -am "My local changes"
    /> git push
